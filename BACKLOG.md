## üêõ Known Issues

### High Priority

#### AI-001: Context Window Animation Issues
**Status**: Open  
**Category**: Manim Animation  
**File**: `manimations/ai_visual_simple.py` - `ContextWindow` class

**Description**:  
The Context Window animation has some unspecified visual or technical issues that need investigation and fixing.

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Render the animation: `manim -qh ai_visual_simple.py ContextWindow`
2. Review the output video

**Expected Behavior**:  
Animation should clearly demonstrate:
- Message bubbles sliding through the context window
- Token counter updating accurately
- Pruning behavior when limit is reached
- Smooth transitions between states

**Notes**:  
- Currently rendered at 1080p60
- Animation has 28 steps and runs for ~11 seconds
- Need to identify specific visual glitches or timing issues

**Category**: Manim Animation  
**File**: `manimations/ai_visual_simple.py` - `TemperatureSampling` class

**Description**:  
The Temperature Sampling animation has some unspecified visual or technical issues that need investigation and fixing.

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Render the animation: `manim -qh ai_visual_simple.py TemperatureSampling`
2. Review the output video

**Expected Behavior**:  
Animation should clearly demonstrate:
- Three temperature scenarios (0.1, 0.7, 1.5)
- Probability distributions shown as bar charts
- Visual differences between deterministic and creative outputs
- Smooth highlighting effects on selected words

**Notes**:  
- Currently rendered at 1080p60

### Medium Priority

#### UI-003: Mobile Responsiveness Optimization
**Status**: Open  
**Category**: Frontend - CSS  
**File**: `webapp/src/App.css`

**Description**:  
While the app is responsive, there may be room for improvement on smaller mobile devices (< 375px width).

**Proposed Solution**:  
- Test on various device sizes
- Add additional breakpoint for very small screens

**Proposed Solution**:  
- Add skeleton loaders or spinners for video cards
- Show loading state when modal video is buffering
- Consider lazy loading videos with Intersection Observer

---

#### A11Y-005: Accessibility Improvements

---

#### FEAT-010: More AI Animations
**Status**: Planned  
**Category**: Manim Animation

**Description**:  
Create additional AI/ML concept animations to complement existing set.

**Potential Topics**:  
- Backpropagation step-by-step
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - filter sliding
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - sequence processing
- Dropout regularization
- Batch normalization
- Learning rate scheduling
- Transformer architecture overview
- Beam search decoding
- Reinforcement learning (Q-learning)

Start with most fundamental concepts, then advanced topics.

---

#### FEAT-011: Interactive Parameter Controls
**Status**: Idea  
**Category**: Frontend - Feature

**Description**:  
Allow users to adjust animation parameters and re-render in real-time.

**Implementation Ideas**:  
- Add sliders for key parameters (e.g., temperature in sampling)
- Use WebGL/Three.js for real-time rendering
- Or: Pre-render multiple versions and switch between them
- Show parameter values as they change

**Challenges**:  
- Real-time Manim rendering not feasible in browser
- Pre-rendering all combinations = huge file sizes
- May need to use different animation engine (Three.js, D3.js)

**Alternative**:  
Create simplified WebGL versions of select animations for interactivity.
